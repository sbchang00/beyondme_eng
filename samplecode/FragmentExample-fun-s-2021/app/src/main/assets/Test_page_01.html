<p>Hello World! ~~~ </p>

<p>Hello World! ... ... ... </p>

<p>I come no more to make you laugh: things now</p>
<p>That bear a weighty and a serious brow</p>
<p>Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe</p>
<p>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow</p>
<p>We now present. Those that can pity, here</p>
<p>May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</p>
<p>The subject will deserve it. Such as give</p>
<p>Their money out of hope they may believe</p>
<p>May here find truth too. Those that come to see</p>
<p>Only a show or two, and so agree</p>
<p>The play may pass, if they be still and willing</p>
<p>I'll undertake may see away their shilling</p>
<p>Richly in two short hours. Only they</p>
<p>That come to hear a merry bawdy play</p>
<p>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</p>
<p>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow</p>
<p>Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know</p>
<p>To rank our chosen truth with such a show</p>
<p>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</p>
<p>Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring</p>
<p>To make that only true we now intend</p>
<p>Will leave us never an understanding friend.</p>
<p>Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known</p>
<p>The first and happiest hearers of the town</p>
<p>Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</p>
<p>The very persons of our noble story</p>
<p>As they were living; think you see them great</p>
<p>And follow'd with the general throng and sweat</p>
<p>Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see</p>
<p>How soon this mightiness meets misery:</p>
<p>And, if you can be merry then, I'll say</p>
<p>A man may weep upon his wedding-day.,</p>
<p>First, heaven be the record to my speech!</p>
<p>In the devotion of a subject's love</p>
<p>Tendering the precious safety of my prince</p>
<p>And free from other misbegotten hate</p>
<p>Come I appellant to this princely presence.</p>
<p>Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee</p>
<p>And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</p>
<p>My body shall make good upon this earth</p>
<p>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</p>
<p>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant</p>
<p>Too good to be so and too bad to live</p>
<p>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky</p>
<p>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</p>
<p>Once more, the more to aggravate the note</p>
<p>With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;</p>
<p>And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move</p>
<p>What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.,</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
